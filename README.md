# CRHM_models

This repository contains models built using the Cold Region Hydrological Modelling (CRHM).
CRHM has been developed by the Centre for Hydrology at the University of Saskatchewan,
and can be accessed from http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/CRHM.php.  

CRHM is described in:  

Pomeroy, J.W., Gray, D.M., Brown, T., Hedstrom, N.R., Quinton, W.L., Granger, R.J., Carey, S.K., 2007. The cold regions hydrological model : a platform for basing process representation and model structure on physical evidence. Hydrological Processes 2667, 2650–2667. https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.

The intent of the repository is to create a library of tested models which will help users to develop 
new models. The CRHM models may contain meteorological forcing data, as well as metadata
describing their creation and use. 

The CRHM models are arranged by geographical region.
