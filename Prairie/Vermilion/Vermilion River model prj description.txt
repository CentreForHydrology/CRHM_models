Vermilion River model prj file description:

VRB_Test_modified_11Dec17_46wetlands_subbasinOBS_spinup_2005-09.prj is the updated Vermilion River hydrological model on
December 11, 2017. The update was made to the original Vermilion River hydrological model prj file: 
VRB_Test_modified_28Nov11_46wetlands_subbasinOBS_spinup_2005-09.prj. 

The original Vermilion River hydrological model is described in the following report:

Pomeroy J, Fang X, Shook K, Westbrook C, and Brown T. 2012. Informing the Vermilion River Watershed Plan through Application 
of the Cold Regions Hydrological Model Platform, Centre for Hydrology Report #12.

The updated Vermilion River hydrological model includes the following changes:

1. Replacing 'evap' module with 'evap_Resist' module; 'evap_Resist' gives better ET simulation as it uses Penman-Monteith for 
unsaturated surface and has better representation of stomatal resistance based on changing vegetation height and LAI. 
These parameters in 'evap_Resist' module are still in the default values, and further work is needed to finish setting up these parameters. 

2. Replacing 'intcp' module with 'CanopyClearing#1' module. 

3. Changing 'ebsm' module to 'ebsm#1' module; 'ebsm#1' is more physically based as it reads directly Qsi input instead of using empirical
equations for radiation estimation.

4. Adding 'K_Estimate' module, the Ks parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity) for upper and lower soil layer as well as groundwater layer
are still in the default values, and further work is needed to finish setting up these parameters. 
The Ks parameters are used to estimate various drainage factors, such as rechr_ssr_K, lower_ssr_K, Sd_ssr_K, Soil_gw_K, Sd_gw_K.  
Previously, these _K values are set as fixed values. Now, with 'K_Estimate' module, they are estimated and vary with soil moisture and Sd storage status.

5. Adding 'Volumetric' module, parameters in this module are still in the default values, and further work is needed to finish setting up these parameters.
This module sets up "fallstat" value based on the soil moisture status on the date you specify to set the "fallstat" (i.e. set_fallstat parameter).
